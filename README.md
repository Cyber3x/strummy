# CLI Guitar strumming practice tool

## What?

A simple cli tool written in Rust using Rattatui. The tool can generate and edit simple strumming patterns. Currently only eight note patterns are supported since this is all I currently need. This will be improved in the future.

## How it looks (right now)
